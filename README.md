# Sprints

##### The place where it will all go down

#### List of things to do:
- [ ] meeting times
- [ ] weekly schedule
- [ ] supervisor meetings
- [ ] weekly group leader swap ideas
- [ ] contact info
- [ ] PR doc
- [ ] resources about sprints and agile methods

- These were some of the things I think would be good to take a look at. Of course if any one of us had issues we should certainly address them. 
- having a few resources of agile methodology like how to give feedback and analyze your progress I thought would be interesting topic.
