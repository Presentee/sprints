2. What went well during this sprint? 

We had a better understanding of how our web app is going to be built. We had a meeting and figured out common questions like, what informations or permissions we need from the user to allow them to use the program, frameworks we are planning to use, security protocols, etc. We already started coding out an admin dashboard using react. 
 
 
 
3. What didnâ€™t go well and could have been done better? 
 
We did not have a set time to meet together and discuss our plans and how we are going to work on the assignments. We are going to be more organized and having a set time meetings with the team. 

 
 
4. What are the next action items (for the next sprint)? 

We can start by planning and preparing some user stories that would be made into features.Then from those user stories we can compile a List for the features that we wanted to Backlog.
